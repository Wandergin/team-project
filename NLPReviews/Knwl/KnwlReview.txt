KNWL (using the default plugins) seems to perform fairly well on simple examples, but fails easily when thrown anything even slightly complex. For example it can deal with "4pm" but not "16:30" or "midday". I believe this makes it unsuitable for our purpose in its default state. However, KNWL allows for the creation of custom plugins. This could be perfect for us, as we could create rules to detect types of keyword specific to our use (similar to how it is currently done with lists of keywords). For this reason I'm recommending it be researched further at a later date.
