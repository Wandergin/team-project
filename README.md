# ResDiary Search Bar

## Synopsis

Aqb is a search bar that allows ResDiary users to look up restaurants using natural language queries.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Aqb takes in user input and sends it out to our api to tokenize the input and fetch back suggestions for the individual tokens.


Upon receiving the tokens the front end client will visually create the tags within the user input.


After the input has been visually tokenized, the users will be able to edit the tags - i.e. remove the given tag, or change the value of the tag to a selected suggestion.


## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
